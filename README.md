# 📈 IBM Stock Dashboard

This repository contains the final capstone project for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. The project focuses on extracting and visualizing stock price and revenue data for two major companies—**Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)**—using Python, API data from Yahoo Finance, and revenue data scraped from the web.

The final deliverable is a clean, reproducible notebook that demonstrates skills in data extraction, web scraping, cleaning, and visualization.
